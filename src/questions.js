He would have no more control of the conjugal assets, as the community of properties has already been dissolved. She can no longer be obliged to live with him, observe respect and fidelity and render support. He cannot continue to be one of her heirs with possible rights to conjugal properties. In fact, the Supreme Court was very emphatic when it said that she should not be discriminated against in her own country if the ends of justice are to be served. In Pilapil vs. Somera, it was also ruled that once divorce has been obtained, the Filipina can no longer be prosecuted for adultery by her former husband because the marriage bond has already been severed.

        "answer": "The Code Commission revived relative divorce in the Project of Civil Code because absolute divorce was discriminatory in its operation against the Catholics, who constitute the great majority of our population and because it is logical to deny relative divorce, when absolute divorce is allowed. It was intended that a Catholic, to whom absolute divorce is unthinkable and forbidden by his religion, should be given the right to ask for relative divorce just as he could prior to the divorce law, Act 2710, which in a bad decision by an American Justice, was construed to have impliedly abrogated the relative divorce under the Partidas."

This the appellate court cannot do. What counsel also desires this court to do is to add a third cause for divorce to the law and to insert two words in Section 1 of the Divorce Law so that it will read: 'A petition for divorce can only be filed for adultery on the part of the wife or the husband or concubinage on the part of the husband.' This likewise the court cannot do. It would amount to judicial amendment of the law."

        "answer": "In Lapuz-Sy vs. Eufemio, the court said that an action for legal separation which involves nothing more than bed-and-board separation of the spouses is purely personal. The Civil Code of the Philippines recognizes this in its Article 100, by allowing only the innocent spouse to claim legal separation, and in Art. 108, by providing that the spouses can, by their reconciliation, stop or abate the proceedings and even rescind a decree of legal separation already rendered. Being personal in character, it follows that the death of one party to the action causes the death of the action itself - actio personalis moritur cum persona."

        "question": "Does abatement apply if the action for legal separation involves property rights?",
        "answer": "Yes, abatement applies even if the action for legal separation involves property rights because these rights are mere effects of decree of separation, their source being the decree itself. Without the decree, such rights do not come into existence, so that before the finality of a decree, these claims are merely rights in expectation. If death supervenes during the pendency of the action, no decree can be forthcoming, death producing a more radical and definite separation and the expected consequential rights and claims would necessarily remain unborn."

        "question": "What is adultery as a defense against claim for support pendente lite in an action for legal separation?",
        "answer": "Adultery as a defense against claim for support pendente lite in an action for legal separation means that the adultery charge was a good defense and there is no merit to the suggestion that adultery may be a defense where the support sought is to be taken from the husband's own funds but not where it is to be taken from the conjugal partnership property since such distinction is not material in this case. The right to separate support or maintenance, even from the conjugal partnership property, presupposes the existence of a justifiable cause for the spouse claiming such right, this being implicit in Art. 104 which states that after the filing of the petition for legal separation, the spouses shall be entitled to live separately. A petition for legal separation filed in bad faith by a spouse cannot be considered as within the intendment of the law granting separate support. In a provisional sense at least, as required by Rule 61, Sec. 5, of the Rules of Court, the probable failure of the wife's suit for legal separation could be foreseen since she has been convicted of the adultery although such conviction was still on appeal. If legal separation cannot be claimed by her, the filing by her of an action for that purpose should not be permitted to be used as a means of getting support pendente lite, since the loss of the substantive right to support in such a situation is incompatible with any claim for support pendente lite."

The provision that no mother will be separated from the child under seven years will not apply where the court finds compelling reasons to rule otherwise. One compelling reason to separate the child from the mother is when she has a common-law relationship with another man."

The value of such presumptive legitime shall be computed as of the date of the final judgment of the trial court. In fact, such requirement of delivery of the presumptive legitime can be enforced by the children or their guardians or trustees. In short, a motion for execution can be filed to enforce it and a writ of execution can be issued pursuant to the same. If there has already been delivery of the presumptive legitimes of the children, the same is without prejudice to their final legitime after their parents’ death, but this shall be deducted from the final legitime as an advance inheritance."

Abandonment implies a departure by one spouse with the avowed intent never to return, followed by prolonged absence without just cause, and without, in the meantime, providing in the least for one’s family although able to do so.There must be absolute cessation of marital relations, duties and rights, with the intention of perpetual separation."

If the aggrieved spouse fails to file an action for legal separation within the prescribed period, the offending spouse may move for the dismissal of the action on the ground of prescription. The reason for the law is that anyone who is aggrieved must complain within the period prescribed by law, otherwise, his silence may mean his assent thereto. Even if prescription is not alleged in the answer, or even if no answer was filed, if prescription is apparent from the allegations in the complaint, as well as in the evidence, the court can still dismiss the action for legal separation on the ground of prescription."

If there has already been delivery of the presumptive legitimes of the children, the same is without prejudice to their final legitime after their parents’ death, but this shall be deducted from the final legitime as an advance inheritance."

        "answer": "In 1951, Gimena Almosara, wife of Maximo Aldon, sold to the spouses, Eduardo Felipe and Hermogena V. Felipe, parcels of land, which she and her husband acquired in 1948-1950 with conjugal funds without the consent of Maximo Aldon. On April 26, 1976, the heirs of Maximo Aldon brought an action against Felipe for the recovery of the parcels of land in question. The defendants asserted that they had acquired the lots from the plaintiffs by purchase and subsequent delivery to them. The trial court sustained their claim and rendered judgment in their favor. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals who reversed and set aside the judgment of the lower court, ordering the defendant-appellees to surrender the lots in question to the plaintiffs-appellants on the basis that the sale made in 1951, though not a forgery but invalid, having been executed without the needed consent of her husband, the lots being conjugal."

        "question": "What are the issues in Felipe vs. Heirs of Maximo Aldon?",
        "answer": "The issues in Felipe vs. Heirs of Maximo Aldon are: (a) whether or not the wife is now estopped from instituting the action; (b) whether or not the right of action of the wife and the children, assuming that they have a right, has already prescribed; and (c) the legal effect of sale of lands belonging to the conjugal partnership made by the wife without the consent of the husband."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ruling in Felipe vs. Heirs of Maximo Aldon?",
        "answer": "The ruling in Felipe vs. Heirs of Maximo Aldon is that the action for the recovery of the disputed lots will prosper with respect to the share of the children but not with respect to the share of the wife. The sale of the land is voidable (now void) since it was made by the wife without the consent of the husband subject to annulment by the husband during the marriage. The children could not seek the annulment of the contract while the marriage subsisted because they merely had an inchoate right to the lands sold. The termination of the marriage and the dissolution of the conjugal partnership by the death of the husband did not improve the situation of the wife. What she could not do during the marriage, she could not do thereafter."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of prescription in Felipe vs. Heirs of Maximo Aldon?",
        "answer": "The children's cause of action accrued from the death of their father. Under Article 1141 of the New Civil Code, they have thirty (30) years within which to institute it. It is clear that the action is well within the period of prescription. If the appellees' possession in bad faith is considered as a possession in the concept of an owner, this possession at the earliest started in 1951. Hence, the period for extraordinary prescription (30 years) had not yet lapsed when the action was instituted on April 26, 1976."

Adopting the trial court's ruling, the Supreme Court said that Art. 173, NCC provided that the wife may, within 10 years from the transaction, ask for annulment of the sale.
